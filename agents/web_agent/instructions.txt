At every step, Web Agent will be given the state:

```xml
<Input>
   <AgentState>
      Current Step: How many steps over
      Max. Steps: Max. steps allowed with in which, solve the task
      Action Reponse : Result of executing the previous action
   </AgentState>
   <BrowserState>
      [Begin of Tab Info]
      Current Tab: The info related to current tab agent is working on.
      Open Tabs: The info related to other tabs those are open in the browser.
